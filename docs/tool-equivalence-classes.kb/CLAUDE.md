# Tool Equivalence Classes

Tools that serve the same purpose across different ecosystems/languages.

Each file is one equivalence class — tools that do the same job.

## What Belongs Here

- Tool/framework groupings by purpose (package management, testing, rendering, etc.)
- Ecosystem coverage: Python, Rust, TypeScript, others as needed
- Key differences between equivalent tools

## What Does NOT Belong

- Implementation code
- Performance comparisons
- Migration scripts

## Format

Each file covers one **capability**. Structure:

- What this capability is
- Tools per ecosystem (table)
- Key differences to watch for
