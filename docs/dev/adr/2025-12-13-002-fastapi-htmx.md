# FastAPI + htmx for POC

## Context

Need a web stack for the Python POC that enables rapid iteration.

## Decision

FastAPI for backend, htmx for frontend.

## Rationale

- FastAPI: async, type hints, websocket support, auto-docs
- htmx: server-rendered HTML, no JS build step, fast iteration
- Both allow focusing on game logic rather than frontend complexity
- Good fit for Claude-assisted development (less context switching)

## Consequences

- No SPA complexity
- Limited client-side state (server is source of truth)
- Will not directly port to wasm+wgpu (that's a rewrite anyway)
