# 2025-12-16-003: TTY Protocol Implementation

## Focus

Implement `__tty__` protocol for colored terminal output, following ADR-010
(thin renderer).

## What Happened

**TDD implementation of tty module:**

1. Created `tty.py` with `SupportsTTY` protocol and `format()` function
2. Added `__tty__()` to `Suit`, `Rank`, `Card`

**Design decisions during implementation:**

- Rank is uncolored (only suit symbols get color)
- Hearts/diamonds: bright red (`\033[91m`)
- Clubs/spades: bright black (`\033[90m`) for symmetry
- Card combines uncolored rank + colored suit: `A` + `\033[91m♥\033[0m`

**Strict TDD discipline:**

- Tests written first
- For ImportError/NameError: only make name valid, pass any code
- For AssertionError: implement minimal code to pass
- Ensured each failing test has a useful error message

## Files Changed

```
packages/engine/src/hearts_engine/tty.py (new)
packages/engine/src/hearts_engine/tty_test.py (new)
packages/engine/src/hearts_engine/cards.py (modified - added __tty__ methods)
packages/engine/src/hearts_engine/cards_test.py (modified - added TTY tests)
```

## Next Session

From devlog 002's "Next Session" list, remaining items:

1. Add `sort_hand()`, `group_hand()`, `Card.parse()` to engine
2. Add `Player` protocol to engine
3. Implement 010-basic bot
4. Implement CLI renderer (Human class)
5. Wire together game loop
