# Matchmaking

Find opponents for rated games.

## Modes

1. **By Rating** - System matches players of similar skill
2. **By Invitation** - Host creates table, invites specific players

## Requirements

- Rating-based matchmaking uses ELO or similar system
- Invited games can be rated or unrated (host choice)
- No bots in rated games (disconnect = forfeit)

## Notes

Deferred to post-POC milestone.
