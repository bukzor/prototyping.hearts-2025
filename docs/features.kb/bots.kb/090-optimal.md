# 090: Optimal Bot

Theoretically optimal or near-optimal play.

## Knows

Everything from 070, plus:

- Learned patterns from millions of games
- Opponent modeling from play history
- Meta-game awareness

## Does

**Optimal play:**

- Minimax with alpha-beta pruning where tractable
- Neural network evaluation for complex positions
- Balance between exploitation and information gathering

**Adaptation:**

- Adjust to opponent skill level
- Exploit predictable opponents
- Randomize to avoid being exploited

**Psychology:**

- Vary play style to confuse
- Make "human-like" mistakes at lower difficulty settings

## Implementation

Likely requires:

- Pre-trained model
- Significant compute for training
- Extensive self-play

## Note

This is aspirational. May never be implemented. Exists to define the ceiling.
