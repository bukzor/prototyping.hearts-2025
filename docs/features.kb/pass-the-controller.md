# Pass-the-Controller Mode

Local multiplayer in a single browser for early playtesting.

## How It Works

1. One browser window, one screen
2. Current player's hand is displayed
3. Other players look away (honor system)
4. After playing, "End Turn" button hides hand
5. Next player prompted to take the controller
6. Repeat until game ends

## Why

- Simplest possible multiplayer for POC
- No networking required
- Enables playtesting with expert user immediately
- Good enough for validating game feel

## Limitations

- Requires physical proximity
- Trust-based (can peek)
- Not suitable for production

## Target Milestone

a001-local-prototype (POC only)
