# The Rest Are Mine (TRAM)

End the round early when outcome is obvious to all players.

## Concept

When a player holds all remaining high cards in a suit (or otherwise cannot lose
any remaining tricks), they may claim "the rest are mine" to skip playing out
the hand.

## Why

Shortens games without affecting outcomes. Experienced players find playing out
obvious endgames tedious.

## UX Challenges

Needs careful design:

- Must not affect ranked play integrity (no information leak)
- Must not confuse players about what happened
- Needs clear confirmation from all players (or auto-detect?)
- Animation/display of "skipped" tricks?

Significant UX discussion required before implementation.

## Target Milestone

Deferred to b-series or v-series. Not in alpha.
