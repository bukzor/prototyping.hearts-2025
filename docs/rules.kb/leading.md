# Leading

Player with 2 of clubs leads the first trick.

Subsequent tricks: winner of previous trick leads.

Cannot lead hearts until hearts are "broken" (a heart has been played on a previous trick).

Exception: if a player has only hearts remaining, they may lead hearts.

## First Trick Restriction

On the first trick, players may not play hearts or the Queen of Spades (unless that's all they have).
