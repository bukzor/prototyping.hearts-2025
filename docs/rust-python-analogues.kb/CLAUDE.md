# Rust-Python Analogues

Mappings between Python POC implementation and eventual Rust production code.
Ensures architectural decisions in Python translate cleanly to Rust.

## What Belongs Here

- Tool/framework analogies (uv :: cargo)
- Pattern analogies (Python idiom :: Rust idiom)
- Library mappings (hypothesis :: proptest)

## What Does NOT Belong

- Implementation code
- Performance comparisons
- Migration scripts

## Format

Each file covers one analogy domain. Include:
- Python tool/pattern
- Rust equivalent
- Key differences to watch for
- Migration notes if relevant
